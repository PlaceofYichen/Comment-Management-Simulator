# Comment-Management-Simulator
##### *The final project for Temple University CIS4331 Principles of Database Systems course.*

## Background
- A startup that provides management services for user comments on websites.
  - Nowdays, most websites allow users to comment on their content. Consider news websites, like Washington Post, Daily Mail, or CNN. Users are allowed to comment on the content of a news article.
