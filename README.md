# cis4331_final_Project
Final project work for Temple U Database Principle course.

The project asks students to create a webpage that:

- allows people to log in
- allows 'author' users to add new 'articles';
- allows regular 'users' to add 'comments' under those 'articles';
- allows 'superusers' (admins) to manage those comments;


Check README.pdf for details and results.
